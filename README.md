# Mental-Health-Prediction-
The Mental Health Prediction System is a ML based project ,individuals monitor and understand their mental well-being based on their daily lifestyle activities, habits, and behavioral patterns. Machine Learning model analyzes the input and generates a Mental Health Score on a scale of 0 to 10
AI-Powered Wellness Assessment & Lifestyle Insights
MENTAL HEALTH PREDICTOR is a machine learning–based web application that estimates a user's wellness score from daily lifestyle patterns, including sleep, screen time, study habits, physical activity, and digital usage. It combines predictive analytics with personalized wellness recommendations and an AI-powered chatbot to help users reflect on their daily routines.

The project integrates a trained Extra Trees Regression model, a FastAPI backend, and a React frontend to provide an interactive assessment experience.

Disclaimer: This is an educational machine learning project, not a clinically validated mental health assessment or diagnostic tool. Its predictions and recommendations are not a substitute for professional care.

✨ Key Features
📊 Wellness Score Prediction — Estimates a wellness score on a 0–10 scale using lifestyle-related inputs.

📈 Assessment Analysis — Presents the predicted score, score interpretation, and submitted lifestyle information.
💡 Personalized Recommendations — Provides general suggestions related to sleep, screen usage, physical activity, study habits, nutrition, hydration, mindfulness, and relaxation.
🤖 AI Wellness Chatbot — Offers conversational wellness guidance with assessment context.
📅 Assessment History — Stores recent assessments locally for reviewing previous results.
👤 User Interface — Includes registration, login, profile, dashboard, settings, and support pages.

Stress Level is handled separately and is not an input feature of the original trained Extra Trees model.

Model Development
The machine learning workflow includes:

Data cleaning and duplicate removal.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Numerical feature scaling.
Categorical feature encoding.
Train-test splitting.
Training and comparison of multiple regression models.
Cross-validation and model evaluation.
Saving the trained preprocessing and prediction pipeline.
The evaluated models included Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Trees Regression.

Model Performance
The original Extra Trees model achieved the following results on the held-out test set:

Metric	Result
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	0.2236
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	0.3168
R² Score	0.9438
Mean 5-Fold Cross-Validation R²	0.9250
These results describe performance on the project's dataset. They do not establish clinical validity or guarantee accurate predictions for new users.

Stress-Level Adjustment
The application applies a separate adjustment to the base model prediction:

Self-Reported Stress Level	Adjustment
Low	+0.30
Medium	0.00
High	−0.50
The adjusted score is bounded between 0 and 10.

Important: These adjustments are application-defined values, not learned effects from the ML model or clinically validated weights. The displayed score is therefore a combination of the model prediction and a separate rule-based adjustment.

The structure above describes the main project components. Your local repository may contain additional files.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Install the following before running the application:

Python 3.10 or a compatible supported version
Node.js and npm
Git
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MENTAL_HEALTH.git
cd MENTAL_HEALTH
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

2. Set Up the Python Backend
Create and activate a virtual environment from the project root.

Windows PowerShell:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install the required packages:

pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib python-dotenv google-genai
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file inside the backend/ directory if the chatbot uses the Gemini API.

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
Replace the placeholder with your own API key.

Never commit your real API key or other secrets to GitHub.

4. Verify the Model Files
Make sure the following files exist:

models/mental_health_pipeline.pkl
models/common_countries.pkl
The backend requires these files to load the prediction pipeline and country list. If your repository does not contain the model files, regenerate them using the training notebook before starting the API.

5. Start the Backend
From the project root:

cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
The API should be available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000
Interactive API documentation:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
6. Start the Frontend
Open a second terminal at the project root:

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Open the local URL printed by Vite, normally:

http://localhost:5173
Keep both the backend and frontend terminals running while using the application.

🔐 Privacy & Security Notes
Assessment history and demo account data may be stored in browser LocalStorage.
LocalStorage is not secure authentication or encrypted health-data storage.
Do not enter sensitive personal information into a public demo.
Keep API keys in environment variables and exclude .env from version control.
For production deployment, implement secure authentication, server-side authorization, data protection, and appropriate privacy controls.
🚧 Limitations
The model is trained on a specific dataset and may not generalize to every population.
Predictions reflect patterns learned from the dataset rather than a clinical assessment.
Stress adjustments are rule-based and are not validated clinical measures.
Recommendations are general wellness suggestions, not personalized medical treatment.
The current local-storage-based account system is intended for demonstration, not production use.
🔮 Future Improvements
Interactive wellness what-if simulator.
Explainable AI to show which features influenced a prediction.
Wellness trends and longitudinal assessment charts.
Weekly wellness summaries.
Improved privacy and secure user authentication.
More comprehensive model validation and bias analysis.
Expanded support resources and accessibility improvements.
🎯 Project Objective
The goal of MENTAL HEALTH PREDICTOR is to demonstrate how machine learning, web development, and conversational AI can be combined into an interactive lifestyle-awareness application.

The project explores the use of data-driven insights to encourage reflection on everyday habits while clearly distinguishing model predictions from professional mental health assessment.
